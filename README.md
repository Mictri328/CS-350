	The point of this project was to figure out a method to implement a fully functional embedded thermostat for a client. This means once it is disconnected from code composer the board must still fully operate on its own. Keeping my code organized and easy for others to follow was an important task which I try to incorporate into all my coding assignments. Also keeping the code short as possible to achieve the requirements is something I strive to achieve. 
As with all my coding projects I try to be efficient but Iâ€™m sure there are other methods and loops I could have used to make this assignment better. The other part of my project I could have improved is turning off all the other lights on the board so only the red light is active during its use. 
	Being able to write small code for a system with low hardware access is something I can add to all future projects. Making code more efficient in future projects by thinking about what room I must work with in memory and speed. All code projects whether it be embedded or not should achieve the goal in the shortest amount of code and work possible. Techniques I used to make the code readable and adaptable are my use of spacing and comments. This makes sure any third party can come in read and understand my code and make changes as necessary.
